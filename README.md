# Real-Time Hand Tracking with Python

A real-time hand tracking project using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
This program detects 21 hand landmarks (wrist + fingers) and visualizes them on a live webcam feed, highlighting key points like the wrist and fingertips. Additionally, it allows controlling your system volume based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.
